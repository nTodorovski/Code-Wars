    <p>
        Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients.
        <br>
        Unfortunately he is not good in maths.
        <br> 
        Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?
        <br>
        Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer).
        <br> 
        For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200).
        <br>
         Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.
         <br>
        Examples:
        <br>
        // must return 2
        <br>
        cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200}); 
        <br>
        // must return 0
        <br>
        cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000});
