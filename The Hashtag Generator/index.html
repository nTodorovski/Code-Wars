    <title>The Hashtag Generator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
        <br>
        Let's help them with out own Hashtag Generator!
        <br>
        Here's the deal:
        <br>
        It must start with a hashtag (#).
        <br>
        All words must have their first letter capitalized.
        <br>
        If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
        <br>
        If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
        <br>
        Examples
        <br>
        " Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
        <br>
        "    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
        <br>
        ""                                        =>  false
    </p>
