    <title>Credit Card Mask</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. <br><br>However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.
        <br>
        <br>
            Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
            <br>
            <br>
            Examples
            <br>
            <br>
            maskify("4556364607935616") == "############5616"
            <br>
            <br>
            maskify(     "64607935616") ==      "#######5616"
            <br><br>
            maskify(               "1") ==                "1"
            <br><br>
            maskify(                "") ==                 ""
            <br><br>
            
            // "What was the name of your first pet?"
            <br><br>

            maskify("Skippy")                                   == "##ippy"
            <br><br>
            maskify("Nananananananananananananananana Batman!") == "####################################man!"</p>
