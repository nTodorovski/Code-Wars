            Number of people in the bus
            <br>
            There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.
            <br><br>
            
            You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). <br>Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.
            <br><br>
            Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). <br>Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D
            <br><br>
            Take a look on the test cases.
            <br><br>
            Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.
            <br><br>
            The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.
