    <title>Complementary DNA</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
        <br><br>
            If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
            <br><br>
            In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". 
            <br>
            You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. 
            <br>
            DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
