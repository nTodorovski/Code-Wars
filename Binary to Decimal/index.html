    <title>Binary to Decimal</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
            Given an array of one's and zero's convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.
            <br>
            Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.
            <br>
            Examples:
            <br>
            Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
            <br>
            Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
            <br>
            Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
            <br>
            Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
            <br>
            Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
            <br>
            Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
            <br>
            Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
            <br>
            Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
            <br>
            However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
