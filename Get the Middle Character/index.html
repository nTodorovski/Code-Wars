    <title>Get the Middle Character</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. 
        <br>
        If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
        <br>
        #Examples:
        <br>
        Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"
        <br>
        Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"
        <br>
        Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"
        <br>
        Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
        <br>
        #Input
        <br>
        A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). 
        <br></str>
        You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.
        <br></str>
        #Output
        <br>
        The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.
