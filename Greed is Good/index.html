    <p>
        Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. <br>
        Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.
        <br>
        Three 1's => 1000 points
        <br>
        Three 6's =>  600 points
        <br>
        Three 5's =>  500 points
        <br>
        Three 4's =>  400 points<br>
        Three 3's =>  300 points<br>
        Three 2's =>  200 points<br>
        One   1   =>  100 points<br>
        One   5   =>   50 point<br>
        A single die can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.<br>
