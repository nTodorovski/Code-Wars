    <p>
            Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. 
            <br>
            Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
            <br> 
            Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
            <br><br>
            ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
            <br><br>
            ##Examples :
            <br><br>
            iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
            <br><br>
            iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
